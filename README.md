### Technical writing style

NEAR Treasury uses a style guide for our documentation so that we can make it as easy to understand as possible. The [Style Guide](style-guide.md) is a concise style reference for our documentation, but it isn't comprehensive. For anything not found in our style guide, use Google's [Developer Docs Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights).

#### Style tips for machine-translatable docs

Making our documentation easy to understand includes optimizing it for client-side machine translation into other languages. To help with this, please see the following technical writing style tips:
- Generally, use the second person ("you") rather than the third-person ("the developer") when addressing the reader.
- Always use the third person when describing NEAR Treasury or features (avoid "this lets us" in favor of "this lets NEAR Treasury").
- Write in present-tense, active voice when you can.
- Prefer simple sentences to complex and complex-compound sentences.

**Note:** Please don't let these style conventions stop you from creating a PR to share your contribution to NEAR Treasury Docs! :pray:
