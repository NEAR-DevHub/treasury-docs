## July 2025

**What’s New ✨**
  
- 📥 [Bulk Payment Import](payments/bulk-import.md): ​​Upload multiple payment requests in one go using our Google Sheet template. Great for handling contributor payouts, grant rounds, and large payment sets.

- 👥 [Batch Member Management](settings.md#members): Admins can now add, edit, or remove multiple members in a single request. No more repetitive approvals for each change.

- 🤝 [NEARN Integration](https://docs.nearn.io/sponsor/treasury): You can now connect your [NEARN](https://nearn.io/) sponsor account directly to your treasury, making it easy to manage the entire contributor reward workflow – from approved submission to on-chain payments.

- ⚙️ [System Upgrades](settings.md#system-updates): We’ve rolled out background upgrades to all treasuries – including a switch to FastNEAR RPC and improved Web4 caching. You should notice faster load times and a more reliable experience. We’ve also built a scalable system update framework to support future contract and UI upgrades when needed.

:::tip
We strongly recommend using the Web4 Gateway for managing your treasury. It ensures you're always on the latest version with the best performance.
