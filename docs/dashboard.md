-   **Available Balance:** The amount readily available for spending or other actions.
    
-   **Staked Balance:** The amount currently staked to earn rewards.
    
-   **Pending Release:** For lockup accounts, this shows the amount of tokens scheduled to be released soon.

-   **Lockup Balances (if applicable):** If your treasury utilizes lockup accounts, this section displays the balance of tokens held within them. You'll be able to see details about the lockup period and any staking activity associated with those funds.
    
-  **Transaction History:** This section provides a detailed record of all incoming and outgoing transactions. You can filter and sort transactions by date, type (payment, staking, exchange), and token. Click on individual transactions to view more details.
    
-   **Charts and Graphs:** Visual representations of your treasury's activity over time are displayed in this section. You can interact with these charts to adjust the timeframe and see how your treasury's value has fluctuated. This helps you identify trends and make informed decisions about your finances .
