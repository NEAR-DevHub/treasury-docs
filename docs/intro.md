## Troubleshooting

While NEAR Treasury is designed to be user-friendly and reliable, issues can sometimes arise. Here are some common problems and solutions:

- **_I forgot my password_**: If you forget your password, you can usually reset it by following the instructions on the login screen.
    
- **_I'm having trouble approving a request_**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions and that the request is still pending. If the issue persists, check the voting duration settings.
    
- **_My transaction is not going through_**: Verify that you have sufficient funds and that the recipient's wallet address is correct. If the issue continues, check the status of the NEAR network.
