# Using a ledger device

When connecting a wallet, you may choose to use a ledger device directly. While many wallets like e.g. MyNearWallet or Meteor supports confirming transactions via a ledger device, there will be less steps if connecting the ledger device directly through the wallet selector.

Click the "Connect Wallet" button, and choose Ledger.

Make sure your ledger device is connected, and follow the instructions on screen to get you through the process for connecting it to the treasury application. Once connected you are ready to confirm every action through your ledger device.
