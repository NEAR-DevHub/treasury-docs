This guide will walk you through setting up your NEAR Treasury.

## Before you begin

:::info
To create a Treasury, you'll need a [NEAR wallet](https://wallet.near.org) with at least 9 NEAR available to cover the data storage deposit for both Sputnik DAO and the frontend hosting.
:::

## Creating a new treasury

1.  Visit [neartreasury.com](https://neartreasury.com) and click "Get Started."

2.  If you are not signed in, sign in with your NEAR Account using your preferred wallet.
    -   We recommend using [Meteor Wallet](https://meteorwallet.app).
    -   Ledger users can connect directly without a named NEAR account or alternatively use a third-party wallet with Ledger support.
3.  Confirm your wallet.
    -   This is the account that will be used to pay for creating the treasury and will be your initial administrator account.

4.  Enter a name for your treasury application (e.g., “myteam-treasury”).
    -   In this step you are creating two accounts: NEAR Account and SputnikDAO account.

:::tip
We currently only support creating new SputnikDAO accounts. To import an existing account, [contact our team](https://docs.neartreasury.com/support).

5.  Add members to your treasury and define their permissions (Requester, Admin, Approver).
    -   Refer to the [Roles & Permissions](https://docs.neartreasury.com/permissions) for a detailed explanation of each group.

:::info
The voting thresholds policy will be set to one vote by default for all permission groups. You can modify those later in the [Settings](https://docs.neartreasury.com/settings).
