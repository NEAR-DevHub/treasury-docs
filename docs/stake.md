## Managing Lockup Accounts

If your treasury has any funds in lockup accounts, you can monitor and manage them in the `Lockups` section. This includes viewing the lockup period, checking the balance, and initiating withdrawals when funds are released.

## Asset Exchange

To exchange one type of cryptocurrency for another:

1.  Go to the `Asset Exchange` section.
    
2.  Select the tokens you want to exchange.
    
3.  Input the desired amounts.
    
4.  Submit the exchange request for approval.
    

## Withdrawal Requests

In some cases, you may need to create a withdrawal request to move funds out of your treasury. This can be necessary for unstaked tokens or other scenarios. The process for creating a withdrawal request is similar to creating a payment request.
